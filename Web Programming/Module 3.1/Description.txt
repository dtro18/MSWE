Environment Used:
Node.js: v22.11.0
Browser: Google Chrome
OS: Windows 10
Computer Architecture: x64

Testing:
To test my webpage, I'd use a variety of browsers and a variety of operating systems.
For instance, I'd check the GET request response on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Opera.
Additionally, I'd use a Unix-based system to check the same browsers, as well as safari.
I would also check the connectivity using a mobile device.

I could also write a script that sends the system multiple requests concurrently in order to see how
the server performs under load.

React features:
I defined a react component to represent a Course, which displays the course's name,
its information, and the grade in the class. I also incorporated a button which can dynamically denote
if a class has been passed by accessing a state variable.

I wrote it in a jsx file, which I then transpiled using Babel. I hosted a local webserver using logic from
previous assignments, and had the webserver access the javacript files.
