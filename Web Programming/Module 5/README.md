Workflow:

ts code written in index/module1 which is just js with type enforcement. In this case, a person is type-enforced.
ts is transpiled using tsc
everything is bundled together into one js file and served on a webpage (including the html file)
specific tags of the html file is accessed thru the js functionality 
webpack also creates server to serve html content
