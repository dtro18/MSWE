Environment Used:
Node.js: v22.11.0
Browser: Google Chrome
OS: Windows 10
Computer Architecture: x64

Testing:
To test my server-side code, I'd use the curl commands in the CMD to test the different API routes
defined by the application. So far, the List mailbox/display message functionality is there, but I would
need to do some testing on the Contacts.ts file to list contacts, add contacts, and delete contacts. 
I would also try testing the application with different loads (i.e. larger mailboxes vs smaller) and
make sure that the application is equipped to handle error codes (i.e. invalid email addresses, authentication)
correctly.

REST:
REST helps the application by modularizing the frontend and the backend, such that requests from the frontend
can be sent in JSON format from the backend, making data transmission structured.
