When using iterators in java,
must overload hasNext and next
then, when setting up the iterator, 
while (iter.hasNext) {
    call next
}

generator
- yield values every time they are called
- keep function state every time they are called
- yield holds execution at a certain point until it's called again
- java doesn't support these??

stream
- overrides related to how the stream will be split into chunks
- milestone 4 - figure out how to split a large json object into a stream of similar objects
- weekly exercise can be solved in two lines
- java gives help in splitting objects: spliterator object
    - must implement an interface Spliterator<objectwanttoimplement>
    - must implement tryAdvance
        - perform an action
        



milestone4
- overload a tostring method
- can lose information in the pass. can remove nesting and just give all objects

end of quarter demo
- 20-30 mins
- demo is 50% of the grade
- incrementally improve previous milestones
- branches are supposed to be temporary
- tags are supposed to come from the main
- find out workflow for branching, prs, and then tagging
