Moderator's note: The following article is a lengthy excerpt from a
recent issue of FIDONEWS concerning individual privacy and the use of
aliases or handles in computer-based communications.  It was submitted by
a comp.society reader who used a handle; because the excerpt is a cross-
post from another electronic publication, I have taken the liberty of
viewing the use of a handle by sender as a request for privacy and
anonymity similar to the request a newspaper editor might receive in a
letter to the editor.  Thus, while reprinting the submission, the name
and address of the sender are "withheld upon request."  The article
raises a number of good points; the submission by a reader using a handle
to preserve anonymity makes a point; and the editorial action of
submitting the reader's posting anonymously makes the question current.
What are the implications of using aliases on the net?

                     THE JOY OF HANDLES

                             or:
        EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT ME
                 (but have no right to ask)

We should never so entirely avoid danger as to appear
irresolute and cowardly.  But, at the same time, we should
avoid unnecessarily exposing ourselves to danger, than
which nothing can be more foolish.  [Cicero]

Do you trust me?

If you participate in computer conferencing, and you use
your real name, then you'd better.

"Why?", you ask.  "What can you do with my name?"  To start
with, given that and your origin line, I can probably look
you up in your local phone book, and find out where you
live.  Even if you are unlisted, there are ways to locate
you based on your name.  If you own any property, or pay any
utility bills, your address is a matter of public record.
Do you have children in the public schools?  It would be
easy to find out.  But that's just the beginning.

Former Chairman of the U.S. Privacy Protection Commission
David F. Linowes, in his book "Privacy in America" (1989),
writes of New York private investigator Irwin Blye:

    "Challenged to prove his contention that, given a little
    time and his usual fee, he could learn all about an
    individual without even speaking with him, Blye was
    presented with a subject -- a New Jersey
    newspaperman....  The result was a five-page, single-
    spaced, typed report which documented, though not always
    accurately, a wide sweep of the journalist's past, and
    was detailed to the point of disclosing his father's
    income before his retirement."

Who am I?  If I don't post, you might not even know I exist.
I could be on your local Police Department, or an agent
working with the IRS, or some federal law-enforcement
agency.  I could be a member of some fanatical hate group,
or criminal organization.  I might even be a former Nixon
White-House staffer!

I could be that pyromaniacal teenager you flamed last
weekend, for posting a step-by-step description of how he
made plastic explosive in his high-school chem lab.  He
seemed kind of mad.

But you're an upstanding citizen; you have nothing to hide.
So why not use your name on the nets?  Trust me.  There's
nothing to worry about.

Is there?

                  WHAT'S ALL THIS BROUHAHA?

      Stupidity is evil waiting to happen.  [Clay Bond]


Not long ago in Fidonet's BCSNET echo (the Boston Computer
Society's national conference), the following was posted by
the conference moderator to a user calling himself "Captain
Kirk":

      "May we ask dear Captain Kirk that it would be very
      polite if you could use your real name in an echomail
      conference? This particular message area is shared
      with BBS's all across the country and everyone else is
      using their real name. It is only common courtesy to
      do so in an echomail conference."

One of us (mkj) responded with a post questioning that
policy.  Soon the conference had erupted into a heated
debate!  Although mkj had worried that the subject might be
dismissed as trivial, it apparently touched a nerve.  It
brought forth debate over issues and perceptions central to
computer communications in general, and it revealed profound
disparities in fundamental values and assumptions among
participants.

This article is a response to that debate, and to the
prevailing negative attitudes regarding the use of handles.
Handles seem to have a bad reputation.  Their use is
strangely unpopular, and frequently forbidden by network
authorities.  Many people seem to feel that handles are rude
or dishonest, or that anyone wishing to conceal his or her
identity must be up to no good.  It is the primary purpose
of this article to dispel such prejudices.

Let us make one thing perfectly clear here at the outset: We
do NOT challenge the need or the right of sysops to know the
identities of their users!  But we do believe that a sysop
who collects user names has a serious responsibility to
protect that information.  This means making sure that no
one has access to the data without a legal warrant, and it
certainly means not pressuring users to broadcast their real
names in widespread public forums such as conferences.

                        *  *  *  *  *

                  SO YOU WANT TO BE A STAR?

         John Lennon died for our sins.  [anonymous]


Andy Warhol said that "In the future, everyone will be
famous for fifteen minutes".  The computer nets, more than
any other medium, lend credibility to this prediction.  A
network conference may span the globe more completely than
even satellite TV, yet be open to anyone who can afford the
simplest computer and modem. Through our participation in
conferencing, each of us becomes, if only briefly, a public
figure of sorts -- often without realizing it, and without
any contemplation of the implications and possible
consequences.

Brian Reid (reid@decwrl.DEC.COM) conducts and distributes
periodic surveys of Usenet conference readership.  His
statistical results for the end of 1991 show that of the
1,459 conferences which currently make up Usenet, more than
fifty percent have over 20,000 readers apiece; the most
popular conferences are each seen by about 200,000 readers!
Mr. Reid's estimate of total Usenet readership is nearly TWO
MILLION people.

Note that Mr. Reid's numbers are for Usenet only; they do
not include any information on other large public nets such
as RIME (PC-Relaynet), Fido, or dozens of others, nor do
they take into account thousands of private networks which
may have indirect public network connections. The total
number of users with access to public networks is unknown,
but informed estimates range to the tens of millions, and
the number keeps growing at an amazing pace -- in fact, the
rate of growth of this medium may be greater than any other
communications medium in history.

The special problems and risks which arise when one deals
with a large public audience are something about which most
computer users have little or no experience or
understanding.  Until recently, those of us involved in
computer conferencing have comprised a small and rather
elite community.  The explosion in network participation is
catching us all a little unprepared.

Among media professionals and celebrities, on the other
hand, the risks of conducting one's business in front of a
public audience are all too familiar.  If the size of one's
audience becomes sufficiently large, one must assume that
examples of virtually every personality type will be
included: police and other agents of various governments,
terrorists, murderers, rapists, religious fanatics, the
mentally ill, robbers and con artists, et al ad infinitum.
It must also be assumed that almost anything you do, no
matter how innocuous, could inspire at least one person,
somewhere, to harbor ill will toward you.

The near-fatal stabbing of actress Theresa Saldana is a case
in point. As she was walking to her car one morning near her
West Hollywood apartment, a voice behind her asked, "Are you
Theresa Saldana?"; when she turned to answer, a man she had
never seen before pulled out a kitchen knife and stabbed her
repeatedly.

After her lengthy and painful recovery, she wrote a book on
the experience ("Beyond Survival", 1986).  In that book she
wrote:


     [pg 12]  "... Detective Kalas informed me that the
     assailant, whom he described as a Scottish drifter, had
     fixated upon me after seeing me in films."

     [pg 28]  "... it was through my work as an actress that
     the attacker had fixated on me.  Naturally, this made
     me consider getting out of show business ..."

     [pg 34]  "For security, I adopted an alias and became
     'Alicia Michaels.'  ... during the months that followed
     I grew so accustomed to it that, to this day, I still
     answer reflexively when someone calls the name Alicia!"

Or consider the fate of Denver radio talk show host Alan
Berg, who in 1984 died outside his home in a hail of
gunfire.  Police believe he was the victim of a local neo-
nazi group who didn't like his politics.

We are reminded of the murders of John Lennon and Rebecca
Shaffer; the Reagan/Hinckley/Foster incident; and a long
string of other "celebrity attacks" of all sorts, including
such bizarre events as the occupation of David Letterman's
home by a strange woman who claimed to be his wife! There is
probably no one in public life who doesn't receive at least
the occassional threatening letter.

Of course, ordinary participants in network conferencing may
never attract quite the attention that other types of
celebrities attract. But consider the following, rather less
apocalyptic scenarios:

    --  On Friday night you post a message to a public
        conference defending an unpopular or controversial
        viewpoint.  On Monday morning your biggest client
        cancels a major contract. Or you are kept up all
        night by repeated telephone calls from someone
        demanding that you "stop killing babies"!

    --  You buy your teenage son or daughter a computer and
        modem.  Sometime later you find your lawn littered
        with beer bottles and dug up with tire marks, or
        your home vandalized or burglarized.

    --  One day you are nominated to the Supreme Court.  Who
        are all these strange people on TV claiming to be
        your friends? How did that fellow know your position
        on abortion?  Your taste in GIFs?

Celebrities and other professional media personalities
accept the risks and sacrifices of notoriety, along with the
benefits, as part of their chosen careers.  Should computer
conference participants be expected to do the same?  And who
should be making these decisions?
